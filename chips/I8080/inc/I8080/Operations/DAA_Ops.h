/**
 * @brief Decimal Adjust Accumulator
 * @details Description: The eight-bit hexadecimal number in the Accumulator is adjusted to form two four bit binary-coded
 * decimal digits by the following two step process:
 * 1) If the least significant four bits of the Accumulator represents a number greater than 9, or if the Auxiliary
 * Carry bit is equal to one, the Accumulator is incremented by six. Otherwise, no incrementing occurs.
 * 2) If the most significant four bits of the Accumulator now represent a number greater than 9, or if the normal
 * carry bit is equal to one, the most significant four bits of the Accumulator are incremented by six.
 * Otherwise, no incrementing occurs.
 * @param memory Memory struct instance.
 * @param cpu I8080 struct instance.
