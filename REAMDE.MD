This is a CPU Emulator project
---
First stage of work is to perform a working emulator of 6502 8-bit CPU with full set of instructions;<br>
Next step is to make it execute a real asm program;<br>
---
This README.MD is WIP document. All progress will be committed. Stay tuned.
---
Emulator features:
* basic functionality: fetch word/byte, read byt/word, write word
* LDA/LDX/LDY instructions
* GTest coverage
---
TODO:
* other instructions
* more tests
* assembler interpreter
* real asm programs for tests
* cpu + memory = computer?
  * interaction
  * hardware emulation
  * etc.
