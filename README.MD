## 6502 Emulator
The 6502 Emulator is a C++ project that is a work in progress, designed for retro computing enthusiasts, developers, and learners.
This section provides an overview of the key features and the current status of the project:
### 1. 6502 CPU Emulation
Our emulator, developed in C++, is in the early stages of development and aims to accurately emulate the MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor.
While it's a work in progress, it's designed with the goal of achieving compatibility with a wide range of 6502 programs,
replicating the behavior of the CPU, including its instruction set, addressing modes, and register layout.
### 2. Debugger with GUI Development
We have plans to develop a debugger with a graphical user interface to make debugging more intuitive and user-friendly.
This is an upcoming project, and our aim is to provide features such as breakpoints, register inspection, and memory visualization to assist in the analysis and troubleshooting of 6502 assembly code.
### 4. Test-Driven Development (TDD) with GTest
We follow Test-Driven Development practices using Google Test to ensure the reliability and correctness of our code.
TDD involves writing tests before implementing features, which helps us maintain a high level of code quality and reduces the risk of regressions as the project evolves.
### 5. Educational Resource
The 6502 Emulator is intended to serve as a valuable educational resource for:
* Computer Architecture: Gain hands-on experience with a classic microprocessor and learn about its architecture and operation.
* Programming: Practice programming in 6502 assembly language and experiment with real-world programs.
* Emulation: Understand the principles of CPU emulation, memory management, and I/O interaction.
### 6. No C++ Standard Library (STL) Overhead
Our emulator is developed in C++ without relying on the C++ Standard Library.
This design choice minimizes overhead and makes the emulator efficient and lightweight, ideal for low-level emulation tasks.
### 7. Performance Optimization
Our ongoing development efforts focus on optimizing the emulator for speed and resource efficiency to provide fast and responsive emulation without sacrificing accuracy.
